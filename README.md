# water-heater-controller
Smart water heater controller with remote control using ESP8266 nodeMCU. The software is designed with MIT app invertor and for the hardware I used DS18b20 (temperature sensor), relays and timer. I also set my DDNS with DUC (www.noip.com) and static ip for esp from my rooter settings in order to control it from everywhere.
